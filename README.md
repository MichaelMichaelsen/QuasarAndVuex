# Quasar App (vuexform)

A Quasar Framework app combined with vuex
This is a small example on how to use the vuex store combined with normal input form.
This is not my idea - but I just modified it so it can be used with vuex store modules. 
The idea is to have a small helper function mapProps to set up the get and set functions.

## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).
